206,633,8501,0,"Part of the problem with the abortion issue goes with our perception of the value of animal life in general. We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it. We see a cockroach and stamp on it. Pests. No problem. But when elephants trample villages, or other warm-blooded mammals become pests, there's an outcry about the destruction method. We don't see giant sledgehammers swatting elephants! - practicalities aside. Destruction has to be humane. And when it suits our purposes. It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al.   From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture. If pro-lifers/anti-abortionists looked at the issue dispassionately and rationally (difficult, I know), then they may well end up with a different viewpoint.   How do we take the emotion out of argument?"

According to the researchers, female bats interact mainly with other females in complex hierarchies during their lives, so that could be why they take more of an interest in echolocation sounds from their own sex......She told Discovery News, ""The connection of the two studies is in the idea that bat communication is more complex than previously documented, since research is finding a variety of social calls to be communicating territory defense and mate attraction, as well as sonar calls, previously thought to only function in prey capture and navigation, to also have a communication role.""

You could argue it would shift opinion towards the mix currently held by women as everyone would be in the position of having to bear pregnancy. Given that there is a full mix of religious and other beliefs in the current day female population perhaps this would be a good analogy to such a state of being you suggest.

I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the ""logical"" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and ""make sense"" to more than one person, these specific ""explanations"" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture."

Evolution  the proposition that all organisms are related  is as highly verified a thesis as can be found in science. Subjected to close scrutiny from all angles for over a century now, evolution emerges as the only naturalistic explanation we have of the twin patterns of similarity and diversity that pervade all life. The basic notion that life has evolved is as certain as the existence of gravity or the idea that the earth is spheroidal. We call such highly verified notions facts when they consistently escape all attempts to prove them false. Evolution is no myth.""Finally, please present evidence."
