17188,0,"The 2020 Global Food Outlook answers this as it says that a greater demand for vegetables will correspond with higher prices of vegetables in developing countries. Many articles acknowledge that starving people cannot afford much of any of the food for sale around them, and a greater demand for meat does not necesarily mean a decrease in demand for vegetables as populations grow globally. Since increasing meat consumption is irrational because it will not feed the poor and it will do even more damage to the environment, again, the solution proposed is to support the initiative for developing nations to become more self-sufficient in growing plant foods for themselves."

Despite being autosomal, people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother's side of the family. Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had, we still cannot tell you the likihood of your children being bald. The chances of the gene combination being expressed in the correct way to cause baldness are dependent on age, hormone levels, stress and probably a variety of other environmental conditions."

Well, 40 years went by, and new officers seeing this law on the books started enforcing it. After all, why not, It is the law, and their is no excuse for the law! Period!

Education about, as well as concern for the effects of overpopulation on the world would also limit population.   Actually, a major factor is pure and simple access to decent and comprehensive health care. Most people used to choose to have large families because so many children died in infancy. If they are assured that their children will live to adulthood, people won't feel the need to have large families to ensure that at least some of them will survive.

Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems. In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things.What is evidence? Well, that will depend on your core belief system. Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system, but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue, the Christian says Thats not evidence!.One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect, so they really have no evidence for their position."

It is the Christian commandment that:

You have yet to admit that this verse exists but, it seems that you are justifying it on the condition that 'love' is involved.
What you mean to say is, 'Women are to submit to their husbands in everything because their husbands supposedly love them.'
Or, are you saying that men are to love their wives and submission is optional?

The Constitution in the United States makes it clear that a citizen is born (or naturalized) and SCOTUS determined any reference to 'person' has never and was never intended to apply pre-natally.   If you mean morally... morals cannot be proven one way or another anyway.   Prove it.   Murder, by definition, must be illegal to be murder. Abortion is not illegal.   It is not a risk. You will be denying women. I think the fact of denying women choice in the matter is worse than the risk you speak of.   Disingenuous. You are ignoring the myriad of options open to a woman with a born child. In civilized society, with any amount of reasonable effort, a woman can find another to care for a born child. The morality is absolutely not comparable."

Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed.

Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing.

Look how crude are the things we make: the filthy, inefficient combustion engine; the computer, unable to make decisions of its own and unable to feel emotions; the microwave, unable to cool anything like a tasty meal. We are, at best, crude emulators of Nature.   No. No designer could possibly have kept track of all the interlocking wonders of the natural world, therefore there can't possibly have been one.   Also, the chances of a designer appearing ab initio in the Universe are of the order 1 in 5x10^90871. I worked it out.   I'll let the Discovery Institute know."

And, as Pandion said before, it stands alone and shows the fact that life has existed in other forms billions of years ago, and humans only appeared recently.   BTW, the ""fools"" that are denying the validity of Geology as a legitimate science are your fellow creationists.

One of the problems with school children is that it's become a crime to discipline them the way our parents were disciplined. There's no spankings, corner times, or sitting on a chair with a dunce cap, because that's all been labeled as abuse to emotional development. Instead we have counseling and the administration of powerful prescription drugs to kids who can barely read.   Kids are spoiled rotten and left unsupervised with TV shows and video games that glorify violence and murdering people for fun. Parents are stuck working two or more jobs just to make enough money for bills so they don't wind up on the streets.   We need massive reform. We gotta go back to how kids were raised in the 50s."

As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty. But that would of course be much different.

23997,0,"Proof that evolution is ""right"" is not necessary to prove that Genesis is not science. Genesis is an inspired poem, and contains truth in its message, but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry, like a song. Look at the repetition, and all the metaphors! Poetry does not imply fiction. THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science.   Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation. For most of us Faith and science work together!   see: songofgenesis.org for more detailed information."

They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering.

The only disagreement was whether the right still applied today.   And no, the individual states and cities shouldn't be allowed to set their own standards for a constitutional right, that flies in the face of the 14th Amendment. And worse, you're arguing for precedent that would basically allow the various states to not respect your other rights; they could ban the shirt you choose to wear because it's offensive to some small, insignificant minority somewhere."

It's always been their favorite argument against PZ to dangle over the head of his criticisms the fact that he hasn't even seen the movie. They can't pull that one on Dawkins anymore, which is to their disadvantage, but fortunately they managed to spot PZ before it was too late."

Creation fiction has made no progress with it's ""faith-based"" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach"

14074,0,I think more than this is the principle of human dignity. That humans have inherent dignity and value at every stage of life. This is transcendent of whether they are conscious or unconscious and it is why we treat 24 week premies who have no real conscious existence and a 30 year old automobile accident victim in a coma on a respirator and you and me the same. So strongly do humans recognize this inherent dignity that even in death a person is dignified with a funeral ceremony recognizing their life had inherent meaning and value. We build memorials to those who were victimized in life.

The attempt to call a zygote a living being is simply more evidence that the religious have no common sense.

Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."

You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.   Your arguements all show a general lack of study in biology and my common sense is appalled by yours.

Incidents such as the shooter professor are incredibly rare; you'll find very few school teachers that were convicted of murder during a previous date, and released from prison due to a favor from a politician.   But incidents like the one in the UK, where the aggressor is in less trouble than their intended victim, are far more common and close to the norm for the country. If you're attacked, you're guilty if you fight back and cause either harm or fear to the person attacking you. Even if they assault you with a deadly weapon, you're the guilty party if you manage to cause them any sort of harm."

Do you just choose to ignore the studies on the terrible emotional and physical problems women have after they have abortions? Look here to see what I mean. Do a search for ""effects of abortion"" on the Web and see if you don't find many more studies with the same results. I could have posted many more links. Maybe you don't know about these studies since the leftist media and women's groups tends to ignore them. Maybe you just ignore them because they don't fit into your world view. Either way, the facts are there."

They read them, and then look at the evidence to hand and say ""Well, it can't be really true the way it is written, so it must mean this...""But the bias of the church against homosexuality is based of a small passage of text which, it seems, cannot be interpreted away. That part that condemns homosexuality is accurate, straight-from-gods-mouth truth. Again, why the dichotomy? Why are some parts of the bible open to interpretation, but others are rigid?"

The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."

Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population."

Not only that, it has been shown that the offspring are also interfertile with either species. DNA analysis has been able to distinguish brown bears from polar bears except in the case of the brown bears of the ABC islands. They are indistinguishable from polar bears.And yet, even if a brown bear where white or a polar bear were brown, they are so obviously different in morphology that they would be classified as separate species. The differences go far beyond color."

Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is.

And then there is the hypothesis that life arose more than once and fused into a single population.

You didn't qualify it by saying ""some"" pregnancies are life threatening or unbearable. Maybe yours was, but how can you say that for every woman in the world? I know for a fact that my wife's pregnancy was not ""unbelievably hard to go through""--she's told me otherwise and I believe her. Sorry, but I believe my wife over you.

At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?"

Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not."

You are incorrect to claim that the brown morph becomes pure white. That is incorrect. It becomes a very light brown and appears to have a blue sheen. That is why it is known as the ""blue morph"". The ""white morph"" is a light brownish gray in summer and becomes pure white in winter. However, the fact that arctic foxes do (not can) change color seasonally is not evolution. All arctic foxes always do change color with the seasons (it happens much quicker than the ""matter of months"" that you state), and that isn't evolution. It is evolution that the arctic foxes, like many other northern and arctic animals like the Mustelidae, have evolved the ability to change colors with the seasons."

No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'.

It is an effect, not a cause, and except among some darwinian true-believers, effects are never their own causes. In this particular instance certain organisms we call eubacteria have evolved inter- and intra-cellular communication systems--a phenomenon not found in, say, grains of sand or salt or the various molecules, atoms, quarks and other 'things' that 'bits of stuff' can be reduced to by materialist/mechanist darwinists.   **   Forgive me, but I'm the one laughing now!!

My days of ornithology and embryology were long ago.Also, since those papers were published there have been several more feathered dinosaurs and primative birds discovered. Things are moving fast right now.

Newton's laws were derived to explain direct human experiences (we deal with relatively large objects going at slow speeds relative to the speed of light) and for that regime, they remain true. Since there were still a multitude of basic unanswered questions at the time in Science (about light, the nature of matter, etc.), investigation continued and found, in the 20th century, the laws of relativity and quantum mechanics to explain occurrences outside of the range of the large and slow that we experience. At the beginning of science (say ~17th century), there were a lot more questions than answers. Now, its the other way around - at least when it comes to the essential theoretical basis behind things that human's experience."

Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem.

It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal."

Sex is a healthy part of a relationship or marrige, and i would not go to these lengths to minimize it. Sex has a small risk of ending in pregnancy, and an even smaller risk if using a condom, and even smaller than that if the woman uses a contraceptive. Then, if EVERYTHING fails, there would be abortion in the extreme circumstances that it does result in a pregnancy. I doubt that criminalized abortion will reduce sex. It will only cause suffering and fear for women.   I thought we were out of the dark ages already."

What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age."

Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it.

The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes."

The Senate will be turned over to a republican majority also, if the rust belt continues to turn right. Good luck to everyone. emoticonXBye

Epigenetics alone can't take one species and turn it into another, so far as anyone knows. It takes genomic restructuring, and that happens only through genetic mutation."

4314,0,Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?

The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria."

It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts.

And here's another flash, socrates. The fact that some organisms die, for any number of reasons, sooner than some of their relatives do, explains exactly nothing. The insinuation that this survival differential has some universal, as opposed to local, efficient cause, is pure fecal matter. And that's all you've got, wiseguy. A simple fact of life, and an insinuated cause, and you think they add up to evolution. Breathtakingly simple-minded assumption, fella.

The civil war was fought to keep the union in tact. Border states still kept their slaves for obvious reasons, the intactness of the union trumped any moral principal. Besides, that wasn't true even in practice. Black soldiers were paid less, had less equipment, had less medical care and were given the worst jobs possible. Hardly created equal. It took some time before they could even fight. Your argument is a load of garbage to someone who actually has knownledge about the civil war.

Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural."

At that point, infants have progressed from the largely self-involved awareness of the 24-month infant as the developing human deals with the problem of separateness and, as a result, issues a robust declaration of independence.

Who proclaims that man and chimps sharing a common ancestor is an established scientific theory? A theory is defined as a well tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observation. A theory has accepted principles. I know of no religion other than atheism - certainly not the Judeo Christian religion - that believe a creator made the common ancestor that man and chimps share. Since far more than half of US residents believe basically the creation account in Genesis, then there's not enough unification or acceptance of that ""theory"". That theory has a presupposition of abiogenesis, or a very similar non scientific basis.

Matthew S. Stated that when people say ""We believe marriage is between a man and a woman."" think that gays are not citizens. I then returned a question saying ""if someone if 6 and can't marry are they going to 'not be citizens' as well?"". The logic behind that question is not to say that gays are 6 year olds but rather that gays are citizens just like a 6 yr old even if both can't marry. In other words, marriage doesn't make you a citizen or not...unless you think 6yr olds are citizens as well. Trying to make it seem like I made a statement out of a question is foolish and should be avoided."

2280,0,"Well let's see . . . the last time a state started recognizing gay marriages, suddenly there was more support for a Federal Marriage Amendment than ever, Democrats lost more seats in Congress, the minority Democratic leader was defeated after years in office, a protestant presidential candidate carried the Catholic vote against a Catholic candidate, evangelicals in the country were energized, the pro-FMA candidate WON re-election even though his approval rating was 50%, and the state that recognized gay marriage fell under a slew of legal challenges to the point where it's up in the air again.The more you push you agenda through activist judges, the closer you get to the people having to pass an amendment. At least New York was smart enough not to do it right before an election."

I've never had a teacher in any of the secular schools I went to say anything about God, for fear of the controversy it would create. Teachers live in fear of controversy, they don't want to get fired. I think this idea that non-Christian teachers try to convince students that God doesn't exist is a fundamentalist paranoid fantasy.   2. How many atheists use the ""you can't see it so it doesn't exist"" argument? very few. They will use the ""there is no evidence so I don't believe you"" argument, but that has nothing to do with whether Timmy can see teacher's brain."

She's either stupid or was looking for any lousy excuse to refuse to cooperate, and then justify her refusal to cooperate with them which is why the Court rejected her argument and threw out her case ala they upheld her conviction and nullified her attempt to unlawfully enrich herself over an issue which she caused herself.

For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. For both the 'braniac"" case you present and for the early term fetus, if there is no reason to kill it, then don't.

But if an educated person disregards them because of impatience, or arrogance directed at the source, it can obliterate the effect of their education. It's the difference in having been taught what to think, vs. knowing how to think. There is a reason why the most successful countries involve people besides only the educated in the political process. "

Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. You've rewritten Biblical Christianity. 2 Timothy 4:3-4 (New International Version) - For the time will come when they will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear."

The problem is there is no faith in evolution, faith is a belief in something with no proof. Evolution has proof. Therefore it cannot be a faith based idea.

One county sheriff along the river encouraged citizens to get armed just for that purpose, freely admitting that his officers will not be there when they are needed the most.

Now hunting rifles, or near any rifle for that matter, WILL penetrate body armor and even the trauma plating like it didn't even exist.   Of course Brady's false claim is based on the fake belief that the FN-57 gives AP capabilities to a pocket gun - absolutely false on every possible topic of discussion.

WHen it comes to evolution, the   theory of evolution is a model to try to explain the observed fact that   evolution happens.   Second of all, Humans and modern apes share the same ancestor. From   a biological point of view, humans ARE apes that have a specialised brain.   The third problem is many religious people take much of the bible as allegorical. That means they are able to reconcilate such things as   scientific fact, (evolution, expanding universe, age of the universe, biology, geology and physics), and their belief in God."

The margin of victory for each of these states exceeds George Bush's margin of victory in that state.

20373,0,Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.

Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology. "

We are well aware that the environment can cause mutations under many conditions (cosmic radiation, x-ray, etc.). What is denied is that mutations are environmentally directed - in other words, exposure to cosmic radiation will not cause a mutation that will make the organism resistant to cosmic radiation. The mutations will be random.   On the other hand, natural selection IS, by definition, the response of populations to their environment. The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population."

If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?"

Take one sentence out of a whole publication that opposes your theory, misinterpret it, and declare victory. Helped by the terminology. Evo dogma dethroned!!! Well, that's the end of it, when the dogma is gone, there is nothing left.   Because he thinks we think like him, where if the Creation myth in Genesis falls, then all of religion and morality fall with it. Or in our case, all of secularism and immorality fall with the CD of MB. Because thinking the way scientists or non-Creationists Christians do is incomprehensible and evil, and what else is there?"

Even the word ""phenomena"" is vague. The reason I said (and maintain) that it's a murky combination of facts and theories is because it can branch off in different ways and follow different paths, depending on the presuppositions (worldviews) of those assigned the duty of directing it. In this case it's the teaching establishment. There is only a finite amount of instruction time in schools. Some paths get more time, attention, and detail allotted to them than do other paths. "

And poor families are less productive, since they are often on welfare.   Granted, this is a rather harsh perspective, but the effect is the same: In the U.S., there are about (21.3% X 1.31 million) 280,000 less people every year who would have likely grown up in a poor home (assuming the child wouldn't have been adopted).

The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events."

That existence would just be pretty dismal without any sensory inputs or freedom of motion (unless they were supplied artificially).   That is what I am heading at. What are we at our very core?

The odds are (1/52)*(1/51)*(1/50)*(1/49)*(1/48) = 1/311,875,200.This could be done for multiple games. The odds get slimmer and slimmer, but the difference is that something had to happen.

15772,0,"I think the problem is, some people believe that gun control, any gun control, is one step closer to the total surrender of all guns. My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold.

Also, what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next? In fact 15yrs ago it wasn't an unconstitutional decision. I guess now it is??? Makes no sense.   Clive14,   those are obviously not my beliefs as I think everyone is equal.   I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else.

A big fat NO.   Porn stars, atheists, necrophiliacs, convicted murderers and even homosexuals can go out and get married right and left. It's not about the ""morality"" of gay people, that's for sure. That is pure, unadultered BS. They'll let gays marry... as long as it's to the opposite sex... and preferably not to their own daughters.   The stictest anti-gay fundamentalist could give a good G*d d*amn about any of that as long as the wedding pictures show a man and a woman."

23219,0,"Private guns were completely private. They were personal property and could not be seized. It was the man that carried the weapon who was required to provide service, and required to provide his own weapon. Since the enrollment and inventory requirements were specifically to ensure that every man had his own private rifle, shot, powder, kit to fight with, it would seem rather stupid to worry that it was infringing on peoples right to bear arms, wouldn't it? Contrast this with today, where registration schemes have been used in places like new york to provide lists for seizure or surrender of firearms. In the one case, you have a law that is meant to insure that everybody has a weapon, i the other, it is a law determined to limit the accessibility of weapons. You really don't see the difference here?"

And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it.

9791,1,"Yes, he did avoid the issues important to me, but then, America's electorate contains a lot of religious bigots, so I was not really surprised. I think he was pretty clear where he stood on abortion rights, though. No chance of another bunch of Romish Supreme Court justices, I think.
And if you think Obama is a conservative, can I sell you a bridge in Brooklyn? He's not as liberal as some, and he certainly isn't left wing -- and no, dear, liberal and left are not synonyms, for all you reactionaries like to make the claim they are -- but look at his voting record. It would make you cringe and me applaud.

19828,0,"When talking to a person professing Christianity, the Bible is binding. If the Bible advises that abortion is murder, then it is so regardless of what the secular systems of the day have to say about it.   When talking with one accepting the principles of Christianity, the premiere of those being that the Bible is binding, the existence of the soul is not up for debate.   The position of Bassman, I believe, would be that there is no legitimate right to terminate a pregnancy, especially from the stand-point of the Bible, which of course, is binding to those professing Christianity."

Did judge John Jones know what was going on in this country 100 years ago?   Why can't today's ID opposing evolutionists see the mistake religious people made 100 years ago, and be enlightened enough to be more open minded about trying to suppress ideas? Maybe because human nature doesn't improve over the generations - following the money always comes first."
