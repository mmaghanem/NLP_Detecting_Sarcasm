They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote. Sweeping changes can be implemented with out the use of force using the system. "

248,6805,0,"Just by being something man made, this cannot be a right. Any right that all humans deserve comes directly from God. For example, life, liberty, and property. I understand that many people do not have health insurance. It sucks, and everyone knows it. It is not a right, it is a good. Goods can be purchased in a competitive market priced based on the law of supply and demand, well in our capitalist society. This is an expensive good, and not everyone is fortunate enough to have it. That is just the way it goes, there are ways to fix it, there are ways to make it cost less, but not everyone is going to get it no matter how hard we try. Unless, God makes it a right, it is not one."
249,3251,0,NO I mean every word of what I type. If they institute these rules I will back off gay claim to marriage and accept that marriage is about children.   As long as they continue to let 70 and 80 year olds get married marriage is not about children and there is no reason to exclude gay people.   I would also add one more lisencing rule   8 No one may have children with out a marriage lisence.
250,2293,0,I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.

He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, ""And the truth shall set you free""!!! "

There is no claim that Archaeopteryx is ancestral to Confuciusornis. If you look at birds now you will see lots of different species. They have a common ancestor but are not descended from one another. Archaeopteryx is just the oldest example of a bird that we have, and considering the distance between the sites where the fossils were found, and possibly several million years in time, I would expect them to be different."

What is dishonest and deceptive about your position is to then extrapolate from that info that it is God who is being deceptive.

It is a way for us to allow all those oddball marriages without putting an ""official stamp of approval"" on them.   Liberals want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriages, thus putting society's approval on these things (something that gets moralists very angry.)   Conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 14th amendment.   Libertarians combine the best of both positions. Their position (privatization) creates the freedom to marry, upholds the Constitution, and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time."

It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes."

They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress.

I don't put any credence in silly comparisons like the trite Kennedy/Lincoln litany that arose in the 60's or the similarly absurd list that INRI posted. They both demonstrate how one can concoct meaningless comparisons in an attempt to invent a non-existent connection between two unrelated events.   It is the same for all ""prophesies""."

But it doesn't rule out Intelligent Design, as an adjunct to evolution by natural selection. I agree that the argument from homology plus genetic evidence makes Intelligent Design less appealing. Of course, the bottom line is that there is plenty of evidence for natural selection (along with genetic drift, gene flow, and sexual selection) as a natural mechanism for evolution, and ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR ID. This total lack of evidence for ID plus its failure to prove that natural selection could not have accounted for complexity in living organisms is really all that is needed to dismiss it at this point."

Now, personally I'd say that's still too vague because 'creation' drags in all kinds of issues that evolution doesn't speak to (eg abiogenesis, cosmology etc), and 'evolution' could mean common descent, the theory of evolution, etc etc.   So we might kick the idea around for a bit and narrow it down to ""Resolved: Hypotheses of special creation of species and common descent are equally well supported by empirical evidence"".   Or, perhaps it's the age of the earth you want to focus on: ""Resolved: all available evidence is consistent with a 6-10,000 year old earth""   I can't do this for you, feindslayer; make up your mind and present a proper challenge."
