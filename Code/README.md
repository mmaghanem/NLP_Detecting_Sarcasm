# 266-Project
Hereâ€™s a summary of all the files in the repo

DISCLAIMER

The project files (below) were created and executed in google colab, which involved connecting Drive directories. This practice made it difficult to generalize the import statements to users without access to the designated project directory. File paths in the ipynb files refer to the shared Google Drive folder used for the project.

Moreover, we have omitted the very heavy files, including:
  - All 9 trained models (.pth files)
  - 8 of the 9 Optuna study objects (saving only the top performer)
  - the raw data from which train_df, val_df and test_df were taken
  - Word2Vec model and embeddings, which were concatenated onto the Bert embeddings

FILES

01_pre_processing.py
  - File to generate Word2Vec and BERT embeddings as well as dataframes for the train, validation, and test sets

02_model_hpo.py
  - Code to run Optuna trials for hyperparameter optimization for all models

03_hpo_analysis.ipynb
  - Analysis file for the best performing model (CNNForWord2VecBERTweet) following the Optuna trials

04_train.py
  - Code to train all nine models

05_predict.py
  - Code for all nine models to predict on the test set

06_prediction_analysis.ipynb
  - Analysis file to visualize prediction results on the test set for all nine models

07_pca_analysis.ipynb
  - Analysis file to visualize embeddings from the test set through principal components analysis; since interactive plots were used, screenshots can be found in the Appendix of the write up

08_embedding_analysis.ipynb
  - Additional embedding analysis along with code for topic modeling; screenshots from topic modeling results can be found in the Appendix of the write up.
